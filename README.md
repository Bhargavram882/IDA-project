# IDA-project
Decision tree based classifier model building using ID3 algorithm.

Built a classifier model based on ID3 algorithm. Divide the data set
randomly in 2:1 ratio using Bootstrap sampling method and then learn the model
using the training data set.The performance measure in terms of Accuracy, F1-score, Precision, Recall and
Confusion matrix are calculated.
